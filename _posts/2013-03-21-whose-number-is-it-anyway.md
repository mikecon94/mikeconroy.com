Recently, I got a new mobile contract with Orange through Dial-a-phone since my old contract (also with Orange) was up (at last!). Since the new contract had been &#8216;purchased&#8217; through Dial-a-phone instead of Oranges&#8217; upgrade process I was given a new number. Not a problem, I thought, I&#8217;ll just transfer the old number to the new contract&#8230;

Turns out it&#8217;s not as simple process as I thought it would be!

My first thought was since it was already a number on Orange I would be able to transfer it easily and I would only have to make the one phone call. It was during this phone call I learnt there is going to be more to it than I had expected. Here&#8217;s a summary of how it went:

<pre>Me: Could I transfer this number to a new contract which is with Orange.
Orange: That isn't possible.
Me: Oh... If I get the PAC code could I ring up from the new sim and use it to
    transfer the number?
Orange: You can't transfer a number from Orange to Orange unfortunately.
Me: Okay, in that case can I make sure the contract will end in 30 days
    looks like I will just have to keep the new number.
*Asking to end the old contract - you have to give 30 days otherwise it will turn
*into a monthly rolling contract, despite the actual contract length being up *
Orange: Yes, I will put that through now.
Me: Hmmmm... Actually if I get the PAC code for this number, then transfer it to a
    different network then back to Orange on the new contract would that work?
Orange: ... Yes that would be the long way round I guess but should work.
Me: Okay. could I get the PAC code then.</pre>

Obviously, I was then given the PAC code. It seems very odd to me that a network can not transfer a number from one sim to another, even through a PAC code? It seems even more odd that I am able to transfer it to a different network then back, why don&#8217;t they have the ability to just transfer it internally?

Now armed with the PAC code I went to GiffGaff and T-Mobile and ordered a free sim, with plans of transferring the number to one of them then back to Orange. To do this you first have to top-up the sim, seeing as T-Mobiles minimum top-up was £5 and GiffGaffs was £10 I used T-Mobiles sim. So I topped up, rang them and and gave the PAC code Orange had given me, not a problem, I was told the number would be transferred the next day. Great, I thought!

I waited 2 days to allow the transfer to go through could then use the T-Mobile sim with the number I am trying to keep. All I thought I would have to do now was get the PAC code from T-Mobile and give it to Orange on the new contract and that&#8217;d be it. NOPE.

I got the PAC code from T-Mobile without a problem, then rang Orange to give them the PAC code. That phone call went like this:

<pre>*after giving Orange the PAC code*
Orange: Okay and what's the number?
Me: *gives the number*
Orange: Okay... Erm... Right...
Orange: Are you sure that's the correct number *reads it back*
Me: Yes
Orange: It's already on a different Orange account, so I can't transfer it.
Me: Right, I have the T-Mobile sim in a mobile right now which is accepting calls
    to that number, so how can it still be on an Orange account?</pre>

Unfortunately, the person at Orange I was speaking to couldn&#8217;t help me. So now I am left with my old number currently on T-Mobile and Orange! Surely, that should not be possible, when I gave the PAC to T-Mobile and the number was transferred it should have been disconnected from Orange, but clearly it hasn&#8217;t been.

I&#8217;m going to try again in a few days and hope that the situation at the moment is just due to the transfer being recent and Orange hasn&#8217;t been updated that the number is no longer on their network!

**Update (28/03/2013):**
  
**Turns out after transferring the number over to T-Mobile in the first place, although it had transferred, it takes a while for it to be processed on Oranges&#8217; end that the number is no longer &#8220;with them&#8221;. So I have now been able to transfer it back to Orange on the contract I want!**
